        <p>Starting Off Small, in the Server making community, making multiple small, decent servers. OPBOX stood out from all of the others.</p>
        <p>With really no plan on what or why im doing this me and one other, mewmix15 we made just around 3-4 opboxes on *cough* minehut...</p>
        <p>After a few weeks or so of developing OPBOX was ready to be released to the public.</p>
        <p>With Opbox being in the top 5 servers on minefort it really just went along with the waves.</p>
        <p>People flooded into the server faster than i was ever able to see and I was overly excited to see what happened to my little idea</p>
        <p>And we are now here with a couple worlds out and more things that i could ever imagine and we now recruited Scarletleaf1000, onto the team to code plugins.</p>
